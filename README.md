fsdata_export
=============

Sample code for extracting CopperEgg filesystem data, exporting it to a spreadsheet (xlsx), and doing some simple analysis and charting.

###Synopsis
This sample code was created in response to customer requests. Its intent is to provide examples of using the CopperEgg API to export data from a user-selected time-frame, do some simple analysis of the data, and programmatically create a few charts in the spreadsheeet.    

This ruby script is based on three components:   
* The CopperEgg API   
* Axlsx, an Office Open XML Spreadsheet generator for the Ruby programming.   
* Typhoeus, which runs HTTP requests in parallel while cleanly encapsulating libcurl handling logic. 

* [CopperEgg API](http://dev.copperegg.com/)
* [Axlsx](https://github.com/randym/axlsx)
* [Typhoeus](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus)
