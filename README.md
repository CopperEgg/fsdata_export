fsdata_export
=============

Sample code for extracting Uptime Cloud Monitor filesystem data, exporting it to a spreadsheet (xlsx), and doing some simple analysis and charting.

###Synopsis
The intent of this script is to provide examples of using the Uptime Cloud Monitor API to export data to a spreadsheet from a user-selected time-frame, programmatically create charts in the spreadsheet, and do some simple analysis of the data.

This ruby script is based on three components:   
* The Uptime Cloud Monitor API
* Axlsx, an Office Open XML Spreadsheet generator for the Ruby programming.   
* Typhoeus, which runs HTTP requests in parallel while cleanly encapsulating libcurl handling logic. 

* [Uptime Cloud Monitor API](http://dev.copperegg.com/)
* [Axlsx](https://github.com/randym/axlsx)
* [Typhoeus](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus)

## Installation

###Clone this repository.

```ruby
git clone http://git@github.com:sjohnsoncopperegg/fsdata_export.git
```

###Run the Bundler

```ruby
bundle install
```

## Usage

```ruby
ruby fsdata_extract.rb APIKEY [options]
```   
Substitute APIKEY with your Uptime Cloud Monitor User API key. Find it as follows:
Settings tab -> Personal Settings -> User API Access

Your command line will appear as follows:

```ruby
ruby fsdata_extract.rb '1234567890123456'
```
    
## Defaults and Options

The available options can be found by typing in the following on your command line
```ruby
ruby fsdata_extract.rb -h
```

Today these options are   
   
* -o, --output_path                Path to write .xlsx files   
* -s, --sample_size [SECONDS]      Override default sample size   
* -i, --interval [INTERVAL]        Select interval (ytd, pm, mtd)   
* -v, --verbose                    Run verbosely

### Output Path
The spreadsheet will be written to the current directory ("./"), with the filename 'hostname-uuid.xlsx'.

To override the destination path, use the -o option. An example follows:

```ruby
ruby fsdata_extract.rb '1234567890123456' -o 'fsdata-20121001'
```
In this example, all files will be written to the 'fsdata-20121001' subdirectory of the current directory. If the specified destination directory does not exist, it will be created.

### Sample Size
The 'sample size' refers to the interval over which each data point is averaged. The sample size in realtime operation is 5 seconds. 

The sample size of the data returned by the API is a function of the range of time requested. Using the default time interval (which is the previous calendar month), the default sample size is 21600 seconds, or 6 hours.If you select a longer time interval, (for example, year-to-date), the sample size will be as long as 1 day.   
 * Note that you cannot select a sample time less than the sample time returned from the API by default. To shorten the time sample length, you need to request data from a shorter time interval.

In the following example, the data from the previous month is exported as a series of one day samples

```ruby
ruby fsdata_extract.rb '1234567890123456' -o 'fsdata-20121001' -s 86400
``` 

### Time Interval
Specify the interval over which to export data. The default (no option specified) is to export the data from the previous calendar month. To specify exporting year-to-date filesystem data, use the '-i' option:

```ruby
ruby fsdata_extract.rb '1234567890123456' -o 'fsdata-20121001' -i 'ytd'
``` 

### Verbosity
To see what is happening as the script is running, include the -v option.


## Outputs

### Analytics:

A set of simple analytics is printed to the terminal screen when the script finishes. The following analytics will appear:   
* Total systems monitored this period   
* Total filesystems monitored this period   
* Number of filesystems > 95% full    
** if > 0, a list of the top 10 most full      
* Number of filesystems that have grown over the period exported    
** if > 0, a list of the top 10 most rapidly growing filesystems

### Spreadsheets

One spreadsheet is created for each system monitored during the time interval exported.

### Charts

Two charts are created for each filesystem, on every system monitored.
